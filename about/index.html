    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>PyOfWave (POW) aims to bring the Google designed communications platform back in a healthy, grass roots, decentralized fashion. We aim to be extendable, decentralized, sufficintly fast, flexible, and user freindly. </p>
    <p>We make full use of XMPP not only for Federation (as Google did) but for clients both native and offline. XMPP already provides us a well tested live decentralized messaging system with web bindings, extensibility, and security forming a great base for Wave.</p>
    <p>For the geeks and corperations using POW to offer Wave services we offer flexibility. POW will fit whatever persistance, authentication, and protocol setup you have. Furthermore using our settings system, you don't even need to touch POW for all of this.</p>
    <p>For end user's, we will offer a web interface inspired by the advice published by Edward Tufte, Apple Inc., and GNOME to offer a superior user experience. The dominant charactoristics we aim for in the web interface are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>User Centered Design</li>
    <li>Consistancy - with world, OS (through semantics), and itself</li>
    <li>Minimal UI, maximum functionality</li>
    <li>Information dense - every visual element is both aesthetic and communicative</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p>Various projects supported PyOfWave indirectly and we would like to think their creators</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Lars &amp; Jens Rasmussen</dt>
      <dd>For designing Wave in the first Place.</dd>
      <dt>Guido Van Rossum</dt>
      <dd>For designing the great Python Language, without which there wouldn't be a <em>Py</em>OfWave</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>And, ofcourse, none of this would be possible without the US Millitary and universities creating the Internet, and immensely helped by Tim Berners-Lee by popularising it through his powerful world changing invention, the World Wide Web.</p>
