Wave URL
--------
Job: To define a method for linking to and embedding waves, as well as identifying wave components. 
Existing Standards: W3C URL, (CSS, XML eventually)

Wave Address
------------
A Wave Address, is in the same form as a XMPP identifier (JID) or eMail address.

Form
---
The Wave URL starts with "wave://" and is followed by the following components (seperated by slashes (/)):
- Wave Address of the account which created the wave
	The domain part does not signal handling by that domain, but serves
	as a means to ensure unique wave IDs.
- wave ID
- wavelet ID
- post ID
- (optional) thread ID
	Prefixed by an ampersand (&). Neglecting infers the replies thread.
- (repeating post IDs & thread IDs drilling the XML heirarchy of the identified wave)

IDs are relative to previous component. Later components are optional. 

Neglecting all components indicate the creation of a new wave, which can take extra arguments.

Query
--
Wave URLs accept query values as follows:
-css - A URL pointing to a CSS file styling the wave XML tags.
	It is not neccessary to respect this query, and will not be 
	considered a critical feature in PyOfWave. 
-alias - A Wave Address to act as an alias for users not on the wave, as 
        described by Federation Format. 

For new waves (URLs with no components), extra queries may be added:
-content - Plain text content for the wave. 
-gadget - A URL to a gadget to be added to the new wave. 
-participant - A wave address to add to the participants, if several specified, all added.

content and gadget queries are added to the wave in the order they are specified.

Action
---
These URLs can be sent straight to the Wave Protocol.
