Full client code, both client (with folders, etc.) and wave (only the wave).

Development Plan:
1. Implement underlying frequently reused views (menus with shortcuts, toolbars, and list Agility shortcut).
2. Implement wave views and the wave client.
3. Get the wave client communicating with PyOfWave server.
4. Create the full client.
